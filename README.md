# Main mechanic

Scroll-driven animations are a common UX pattern on the web. These are **animations that are linked to the scroll position of a scroll container**. This means that as you scroll up or down, the linked animation scrubs forward or backward in direct response. Think of interesting effects such as parallax background images or reading indicators which move as you scroll. A similar type of scroll-driven animation is **an animation that is linked to an element's position within its scroll container**. With it, for example, elements can fade-in as they come into view.
